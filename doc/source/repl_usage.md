# Using the Faunanet REPL
The `Faunanetlab` REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print loop) has been encountered already in {doc}`getting_started`. It's the main way to interact with a running `Faunanetlab` instance.
To get a list of available commands you can run `help` in a running REPL: 
```bash 
faunanetlab
(Faunanetlab) help 

```
