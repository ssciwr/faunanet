# Getting started 

## What is Faunanet-lab? 
*Faunanet-lab* is an extension of [*Birdnet-Analyzer*](https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-Analyzer), and uses [*birdnetlib*](https://github.com/joeweiss/birdnetlib) as its basis. 
*Faunanet-lab* was developed with the goal to provide a platform for bioacoustics research projects, started at the Interdisciplinary center for scientific computing at the University of Heidelberg. 
Using the basic birdnet-model by default, *Faunanet-lab* provides three core features: 

- The possibilty to easily and arbitrarily exchange the underlying maching learning model
- Easy configuration using YAML files which are stored alongside the analysis results 
- An integrated, extendible REPL with which to interact with the system while it runs.
