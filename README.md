# iSparrow - Smart-IoT-based Passive bioAcoustic monitoRing of site-specific co-pResence of zOonotic Wildlife hosts and humans

iSparrow provides a flexible software for running bioacoustic classification machine learning systems on raspberry-Pi. By default, it uses the models provided by [Birdnet-Analyzer](https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-Analyzer/tree/main), but can also use other models the user provides.

It achieves this by extending [birdnetlib](https://github.com/joeweiss/birdnetlib).
